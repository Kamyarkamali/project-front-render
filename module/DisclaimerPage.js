          ‘Matched betting’ you say?
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#26645F] text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">
          I’d started playing a lot of online poker in the faint hope that maybe
          I could earn a living from it. Although I was in profit overall, I
          wasn’t going to be giving up the day job any time soon.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#26645F] text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">
          It was during a home poker game with some friends that I was
          introduced to matched betting. I’d placed the odd football bet here
          and there, but I wasn’t aware of this new game changing strategy. I
          explored things further and it wasn’t long before I’d made an easy
          £1,000 profit from new customer offers.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#26645F] text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">
          Once I’d completed the sign up offers, I went back to playing poker. I
          thought I was done with matched betting. Then one day I received an
          email from a bookmaker offering me an incentive to keep betting. It
          was the sort of email I would have ordinarily deleted, but it got me
          wondering if there was money to be made beyond the sign up offers.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#26645F] text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">
          I was soon making around £500 each month without too much fuss and it
          was pretty satisfying!

          The blog
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#26645F] text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">
          The one thing that really struck me when researching matched betting,
          was the lack of information available. Very few people were talking
          about it. I was keen to share my progress and encourage others to get
          involved, so I set up Matched Betting Blog.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#26645F] text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">
          I struggled to gain an audience for some time, pretty much talking to
          myself for the best part of a year. I’d blog first thing in the
          morning, go to work and then blog when I got home. I started to wonder
          if it was worth the hassle, but I was in a rhythm, so I kept going.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#26645F] text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">
          In 2015, things changed. Subscription based sites were popping up all
          over and the popularity of matched betting was suddenly growing at a
          rapid rate. Traffic to the blog had started to flow and it wasn’t long
          before the place was a hive of activity. The profile of matched
          betting had changed massively.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#26645F] text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">
          As time went on, I found myself doing less matched betting and more
          blogging. It was demanding more and more of my time, so in 2016 I gave
          up the day job to focus on the blog.

        <p className="text-[#26645F] text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">
          My aim has always been to build a resource that makes matched betting
          accessible to everyone.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#26645F] text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">
          Don’t get me wrong, there are some fantastic subscription based sites
          out there with whole teams of people behind them. They’re great for
          maximising your profits if you’re comfortable with the monthly outlay.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#26645F] text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">
          The blog has always been free to use and it’s great that so many
          people use it on a daily basis. The blog has helped people in a number
          of different ways, from clearing debts to luxury holidays. It’s
          fantastic to hear those stories, to know that the site has helped
          change some people’s lives for the better.
